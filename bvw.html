      <h2>Building Virtual Worlds</h2>
      <p class="tagline">Building Virtual Worlds is a course at Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center that
        focuses on rapid prototyping. Over a semester, we were put into 4 diverse teams of 2 artists, 2 programmers, and
        a sound designer each and tasked us with creating a virtual world in 2 weeks (with a playable version ready in a
        week). I was a <b>programmer</b> in these projects, and took on the additional <b>producer</b> role in some of
        them.</p>

      <h3>World 1: Creating an interface to perform a task</h3>
      <p>We built on the prompt “bathing a cat”, using the Microsoft Xbox adaptive controllers to create a cat spa world
        with good user affordance.
      </p>
      <p>Our main challenge was to design an interface that will allow users to perform certain "verbs" using the
        adaptive controllers. We picked the task of bathing a cat. This world also focused on creating a satisfying
        interest curve for guests.</p>

      <h3>World 2: Intuitive VR Experience for Naive Users</h3>
      <p>Built for <u>Quest 3</u>, this is an ongoing project where I’m serving as a <b>programmer</b> and a <b>producer</b>.


      </p>
      <p>This project has a focus on introducing new entertainment technology to guests who may not be familar with it, and required us to build a VR world where a naïve user feels they have a high degree of agency, while also limiting their range of actions, so that they would perform the tasks we have predicted they would.
      </p>
      <p>We worked on a horror-themed escape room for this world.

  <h3>World 3: Lightning Round</h3>
  <p>Our task was to build a multiplayer experience while exploring weird platforms in a week.
  </p>
  <p>We decided to create a 2-player experience with DDR pads. Our world was a 2.5D collaborative game where the players had to communicate with eachother to move together and collect treasures, avoid curses, and strategize to avoid dropping a treasure chest held between them.

      <h3>World 4: Festival Round</h3>
      <p>We were tasked to build an experience for the annual ETC festival showcasing students' BVW rounds. The objectives were to create an experience with a good throughput, that can be enjoyed by multiple players and is a short experience.</p>
      <p>Our world explored a fantasy land and the story of a human and a spirit, both with different abilities in the world, and who can see and understand different things, navigating a journey of escaping a ghost.</p>
      <p>I was a programmer and producer, and also worked as a technical artist, creating trail and glitch shaders that fit the world.
