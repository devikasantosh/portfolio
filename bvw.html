      <h2>Building Virtual Worlds</h2>
      <p class="tagline">Building Virtual Worlds is a course at Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center that
        focuses on rapid prototyping. Over a semester, we were put into 4 diverse teams of 2 artists, 2 programmers, and
        a sound designer each and tasked us with creating a virtual world in 2 weeks (with a playable version ready in a
        week). I was a <b>programmer</b> in these projects, and took on the additional <b>producer</b> and <b>technical artist</b> roles in some of
        them.</p>

      <h3>World 1: Creating an interface to perform a task</h3>
      <p>We built on the prompt “bathing a cat”, using the Microsoft Xbox adaptive controllers to create a cat spa world
        with good user affordance.
      </p>
      <p>Our main challenge was to design an interface that will allow users to perform certain "verbs" using the
        adaptive controllers. We picked the task of bathing a cat. This world also focused on creating a satisfying
        interest curve for guests.</p>

      <h3>World 2: Intuitive VR Experience for Naive Users</h3>
      <p><i>Your car crashes outside snowy Virginia, and the only place you can go to for help is the mysterious cabin in the woods. The radio warnings of the ongoing snow storms and the nearby "bear attacks" seem... not-as-commonplace when you rift through the dead stranger's conspiracy board and cryptid-hunting trophies.
      </i></p><br>
      <p>Built for <u>Quest 3</u>, this is an ongoing project where I’m serving as a <b>programmer</b> and a <b>producer</b>.


      </p>
      <p>This project has a focus on introducing new entertainment technology to guests who may not be familar with it, and required us to build a VR world where a naïve user feels they have a high degree of agency, while also limiting their range of actions, so that they would perform the tasks we have predicted they would.
      </p>
      <p>We worked on a horror-themed escape room for this world.
      </p>
      <p>Worked on production and VR programming for all the world's interactions. Also implemented <b>inverse kinematics</b> animations to make the monster always face the VR camera, and turn its head according to the user's position.</p>

  <h3>World 3: Lightning Round</h3>
  <p>Our task was to build a multiplayer experience while exploring weird platforms in a week.
  </p>
  <p>We decided to create a 2-player experience with DDR pads. Our world was a 2.5D collaborative game where the players had to communicate with eachother to move together and collect treasures, avoid curses, and strategize to avoid dropping a treasure chest held between them.

      <h3>World 4: Festival Round</h3>
      <p><i>A lost human and a forest spirit must work together to navigate an enchanted land and serve a ghost's requests. The two complement eachothers' abilities, and are navigating a winding backstory of long-lost memories. However, when the ghost's final request is for the human themselves, they find themselves caught in a deadly chase.
      </i></p><br>
      <p>We were tasked to build an experience for the annual ETC festival showcasing students' BVW rounds. The objectives were to create an experience with a good throughput, that can be enjoyed by multiple players and is a short experience.</p>
      <p>Our world explored a fantasy land and the story of a human and a spirit, both with different abilities in the world, and who can see and understand different things, navigating a journey of escaping a ghost.</p>
      <p>I was a <b>programmer and producer</b>, and also worked as a <b>technical artist</b>, creating trail and glitch shaders that fit the world.

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>Our main challenge was audience throughput, and figuring out how to make the experience accommodate as many guests as we can, and still feel interesting to people who have already watched others playing it. Since we'd decided on making a puzzle game, maintaining the element of surprise was crucial.</p>
