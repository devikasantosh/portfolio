      <p><i>A lost human and a forest spirit must work together to navigate an enchanted land and serve a ghost's requests. The two complement eachothers' abilities, and are navigating a winding backstory of long-lost memories. However, when the ghost's final request is for the human themselves, they find themselves caught in a deadly chase.
      </i></p><br>
      <p>We were tasked to build an experience for the annual ETC festival showcasing students' BVW rounds. The objectives were to create an experience with a good throughput, that can be enjoyed by multiple players and is a short experience.</p>
      <p>Our world explored a fantasy land and the story of a human and a spirit, both with different abilities in the world, and who can see and understand different things, navigating a journey of escaping a ghost.</p>
      <p>I was a <b>programmer and producer</b>, and also worked as a <b>technical artist</b>, creating trail and glitch shaders that fit the world.

      <h3>Project Details</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Time: </b>2 week.</li>
        <li><b>Role: </b>Producer, Programmer, Technical Artist</li>
        <li><b>Software and Platforms: </b>Unity Engine, XBox Controllers</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Team</h3>
      <p>Joy Lim, Sharon Liu, Winnie Tsai</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>Our main challenge was audience throughput, and figuring out how to make the experience accommodate as many guests as we can, and still feel interesting to people who have already watched others playing it. Since we'd decided on making a puzzle game, maintaining the element of surprise was crucial.</p>
