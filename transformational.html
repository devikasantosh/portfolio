      <h3>The Assignment</h3>
      <p>We were tasked to pitch interactive projects to be mounted somewhere in Washington DC, with an imaginary $2
        million budget and an imaginary year to create. We had to also research which site it will be mounted in, and
        it's availability, the manpower, and schedule.</p>

          <p><b>Constraints and Criteria:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Interactive</li>
            <li>Make humans aware of their complicity</li>

      <h4><b>The Prompt: You are Complicit, and You can make a difference.</b></h4>
      <p>You are to create an <b>interactive</b> experience about some real-world issue, set in the
        present day. The Guest performs a task in which there is at least ONE decision they
        make. Regardless of the decision, your goal is the make the guest feel <b>something
          important</b>.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Our Exhibit</b></p>
      <p>We wanted to focus on how history is always written by the victor, and how we are complicit in whether or not
        we educate ourselves on what's happening in the world, because today's present is tomorrow's history. We really
        wanted to focus on erased stories and silenced voices, and how information that is out today may be gone
        tomorrow.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>The Concept</b></p>
      <p>A physical structure with audio interactive components.</p>
      <p>As you walk past it, you hear voices telling their stories. You feel educated, like you're learning something
        new. <i>And then suddenly, the voices are cut off.</i> Radio silence. You try to move back to where you heard
        the voices, you try to bring them back, to hear the end of their story, but you can't. It's lost.</p>

    <i>Early concept inspiration, and sketch. Notice how one side is higher to represent the information always being
      louder. The other sides sees a smaller voice, taking a long time to rise; and when it does, it's shut down almost
      immediately, and again takes a long time to gather up and rise again.</i>
    <br><br>
    <p><b>Ideation</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to information opens up and shuts down in waves. We have knowledge and then lose access and interest in
        it, as it becomes more scarce.</li>
      <li>We propose a <b>sculpture with an element of audio interactivity</b> to depict these waves of knowledge and
        access to
        it.</li>
      <li>As the listener walks past the sculpture – audio keeps rising and they’re learning, getting more knowledge.
      </li>
      <li>Then, suddenly, the voice cuts off.</li>
      <li>Concept of being at the right place, right time</li>
      <li>Listeners are complicit</li>
      <li>Trying to educate yourself -> trying to help out</li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <p><b>Further Ideation</b></p>

    <p><b>Core Ideas</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The truth</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Educating the public</li>
        <li>One story that has been lost/hidden - voice grows and cuts off</li>
        <li>Book bannings</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Two sides of the story</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Showing how history can be manipulated
        </li>
        <li>Watered down version/misinformation vs real story
        </li>
        <li>Racial profiling - police radio vs real history
        </li>
        <li>Inventions - commercials/what became of it vs the real beginnings
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    <p><b>Deciding a theme</b></p>
    <p>The team agreed upon using the erasure of women's contributions in history as the underlying theme of the exhibit.</p>
<p>We also decided to incorporate a digital, AR segment to the installation alongside the physical one we had planned.</p>
