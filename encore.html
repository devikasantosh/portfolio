      <h2>Encore</h2>
      <h3>Titanic the Musical pre-show experience for CMU's School of Drama</h3>
      <p>Currently working as an <b>experience designer</b> and <b>narrative designer</b> for a pre-show experience for
        CMU’s School of Drama production of Titanic the Musical, as part of a client project with CMU’s Entertainment
        Technology Center.</p>

      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p>Exploring the lives and stories of the characters through their luggage. The musical represents the passengers
        and their dreams and hopes for their future in America. <br>It focuses on the class disparities between them -
        the Third-Class immigrants dream of a better life in America, the Second Class imagine they too can join the
        lifestyles of the rich and famous, while the millionaire Barons of the First Class anticipate legacies lasting
        forever.</p>
      <p>We also plan to make our experience change with time, during the run of the show.</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
      <li>The beginning represents the passengers boarding the ship - bright and hopeful, with countless dreams.</li>
      <li>The intermission begins right after the ship hits the iceberg. We wanted a feeling of panic, danger, and a
        sense of rush.</li>
      <li>The show ends on a melancholic note, and there are accounts of passengers on lifeboats remembering the dark,
        starry sky they saw as the ship sank because they were in the middle of the sea on a moonless night. We wanted
        to replicate this and create a mood for introspection and quiet stillness.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>We plan to change the lighting, visuals, and soundscapes through these three parts of the experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We plan to have a bright and sunny pre-show, symbolising the luggage being boarded onto the ship, and the
          sounds of seagulls and shipyards.</li>
        <li>During the intermission, we plan to use ocean floor gobos and theatrical lighting to create a blue tinged
          effect, fog machines and cooling the room down, and harsh lighting to represent warning signals. The
          soundscape is going to be unsettling, with the ship creaking ominously, and water splashing precariously.</li>
        <li>Our post-show will be quiet and reflective, an almost dark stillness. We expect the audience to be quiet and
          thoughtful at the end of the performance, and want the environment to be eerily unsettling, and yet calm. The
          soundscape would be silent, either with no sound playing, or using noise-cancelling effects to make it more
          unsettling.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Our challenges include fabricating the luggage stations, programming the Arduino for the functions we want, and
        encouraging guests to touch and interact with the exhibit. Another major challenge is making the sound
        technology audible in a lobby full of theater-goers.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Quick User Journey - Interactions</h2>
      <p>As the user walks past a luggage station, a motion sensor detects their presence and the trunk opens, with a
        programmed light tracing the outlines of the props inside, encouraging them to interact with it. We would use
        directional speakers to play an audio recording of the character narrating, also triggered by the motion sensor.
        The guests can explore the props inside - rift through the characters' clothing, read their diaries and letters,
        examine their possessions, and thereby understand and empathise with their stories.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>I am working as the <b>experience designer</b> and the <b>narrative designer</b> on the project.</p>
      <p>I will be crafting user journeys and personas for our young and old audience, and making sure the experience
        feels complete even if they miss any or more of the three parts.</p>
      <p>I will also be conducting extensive research into the characters' lives, who they were to others, and how they
        each spoke or wrote, and would mimic these and create stories for them that I'll write in their journals,
        diaries, and pocketbooks.</p>
      <p>I am also going to be creating a strong and engaging narrative for the whole experience, to ensure guests
        connect with these characters.</p>
      <p>For the Entertainment Technology Center, I am designing our team's logo, poster, and halves sheet, too.</p>
